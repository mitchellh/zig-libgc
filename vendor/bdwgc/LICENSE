Several files (gc/gc_allocator.h, extra/msvc_dbg.c) come with slightly
different licenses, though they are all similar in spirit (the exact
licensing terms are given at the beginning of the corresponding source file).

A few of the files needed to use the GNU-style build procedure come with
a modified GPL license that appears not to significantly restrict use of
the collector, though use of those files for a purpose other than building
the collector may require the resulting code to be covered by the GPL.
